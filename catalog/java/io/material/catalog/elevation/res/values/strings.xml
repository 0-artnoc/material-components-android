  <string name="cat_elevation_fragment_description">Elevation in Material Design is measured as
    the distance between Material surfaces. The distance from the front of one Material surface to
    the front of another is measured along the z-axis in density-independent pixels (dps) and
    depicted (by default) using shadows. This demo illustrates the proper rendering of shadows at
    different elevations.
