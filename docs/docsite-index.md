# Material Components for Android

Material Components for Android provides modular and customizable UI components
to help developers easily create beautiful apps.

## Usage

1. To use the Material Components library with the Gradle build system, include
the library in the build.gradle dependencies for your app.

  ```groovy
  dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:design:[Library version code]'
  }
  ```
2. Add a reference to the component (widget) that you want to use in your XML
layout. (You can also dynamically instantiate a widget in Java.)

  ```xml
  <android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton android:id="@id/fab" />
  ```

2. You can then reference that widget in your Java class.

  ```java
  FloatingActionButton fab = (FloatingActionButton) findViewById(R.id.fab);
  ```

3. Make sure you have an import statement for the component. Most IDEs add and
organize import statements by default.

  ```java
  import android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton;
  ```
